Hi, I'm James

I'm a lead software engineer focusing on Ruby on Rails, React and React Native. Passionate about application architecture, security and scalability.

In my free time I like to dabble in game development (Unreal Engine), and I'm terrible at ever finishing a project.

I have been working with Ruby on Rails profesionally since 2006.

Currently employed at [Good Dog Design](https://gooddogdesign.com/).
